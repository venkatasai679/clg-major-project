                        <p>Efficient and secure file transfer in the cloud through double encryption using AES and RSA algorithms ensures both speed and robust security for sensitive data. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), a symmetric encryption algorithm, is used for fast data encryption, ensuring high performance during file transfer. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), an asymmetric encryption algorithm, is employed for securing the encryption keys. In this approach, the file is first encrypted using AES with a randomly generated key, and then the AES key itself is encrypted using RSA. This double encryption process ensures that even if an attacker intercepts the encrypted file or key, without the private RSA key, they cannot decrypt the AES key or access the original data. By combining AES for efficiency and RSA for secure key exchange, this method provides a highly secure and scalable solution for cloud file transfer, addressing both confidentiality and integrity concerns in cloud storage systems.</p>
